# House Price Prediction
This repository contains the code and resources for my house price prediction project. In this project, I explored a dataset containing a wide range of features related to residential properties with the goal of predicting house prices. Below, you'll find a brief overview of the project and how to navigate this repository.
## Overview
**Dataset Description**: The dataset contains various features related to residential properties, including size, quality, location, and more. The target variable is the sale price of the properties.
## Project Stages:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** I conducted a thorough exploration of the dataset to understand its characteristics, visualize important patterns, and identify potential relationships between features.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** This phase involved feature engineering, handling missing values, and transforming categorical variables into a suitable format for machine learning models.

3. **Model Building:** I implemented two main models for house price prediction: Linear Regression and Random Forest. Each model was evaluated and fine-tuned to achieve the best possible predictions.
